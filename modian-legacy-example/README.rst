=======================
 modian-legacy-example
=======================

This is an example of a system that runs a legacy modian image inside
qemu.

To build this you need to first build an iso of a modian system (e.g.
one of the modian-full-example-*), and point to it in the environment
variable $TBD.

The legacy iso will be included in the generated iso.
