Description: Wrapper for vmdebootstrap for creating live images
 live-wrapper is a wrapper around vmdebootstrap to install a live Debian
 system into an ISO image, which can be used by booting from optical media or a
 USB device.
 .
 This is a fork of live-wrapper that removes the need for vmdebootstrap.
 .
 isolinux and grub2 bootloaders can be supported, depending on the distribution
 and the architecture.
