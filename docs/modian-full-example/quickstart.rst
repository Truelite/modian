 Quickstart

Setup
=====

To build a fully featured modian project like ``modian-full-example``
you need:

* an installation of modian-live-wrapper;
* a deb repository with the onther ``modian-*`` packages.

If you installed ``modian-live-wrapper`` from a repository you're
probably ok.

If you are working on modian itself and want to run a locally modified
version of the code, see :doc:`devel`.
